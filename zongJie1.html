				<p class="title-red">Interview:</p>
				<p>I took interview to some UNSW's students
					and choosing some of them to anaylise the
					data. The interview data shows below.</p>
				<p class="kuang-q">Q1: How do you feel about CCC?</p>
				<p>A1：Helping them is warm hearted, but without
					containment they are a threat to the eco-system.</p>
				<p>A2：CCC is an organization that volunteers to help
					stray cats</p>
				<p>A3: Great idea to make campus warm and lovely.</p>
				<p class="kuang-q">Q2: What do you want to see in the website?</p>
				<p>A1：I want to see your knowledge and professional. I
					wish to ensure that I have entrusted capable people.</p>
				<p>A2: There can be some precautions and rules for
					adopting small animals, to teach you how to take better
					care of a small animal.</p>
				<p>A3: I want to see successful example in your website.</p>
				<p class="kuang-q">Q3: What are the reasons if you willing to support us?</p>
				<p>A1：I love animals. And I support you if I can assure
					you are doing thing right.</p>
				<p>A2: Because there are a lot of stray cats around
					the school, they are homeless, I hope there is an
					organization like this to help them.</p>
				<p>A3: Using a good way to protect both animal and
					environment.</p>
				<p class="kuang-q">Q4: What are the reasons if you are willing join our
					group or TNR program?</p>
				<p>A1: When I found out that you are actually helping
					with the cats, also the environment</p>
				<p>A2: I'm agree of the idea that you don't adopt a stray
					cat when you don't have the skills or knowledge to do
					so</p>
				<p>A3: If this group are really care about campus cat rather
					than money. It looks good but I do not know it is true
					or not.</p>
				<div class="phone-p">
					<p class="kuang-q">Q5: What frustrate you when you think about
						donating a charity?</p>
					<p>A1: Usually donating to charity I am afraid of
						corruption; money goes to someone's pocket rather
						than put in real use. But small group like you should be
						alright.</p>
					<p>A2: When some immoral public welfare organizations,
						in the name of public welfare, take the goods donated
						by people and use them for their own use, they don't
						take good care of small animals and abuse them</p>
					<p>A3: I think the money we donate should use to helping
						cats, not for “activity funds.”</p>
					<p>A4:</p>
					<p class="kuang-q">Q6: How much do you wish to donate CCC?</p>
					<p>A1: Depends on my financial situation at the time and
						how your work come along. Probably around 100$ or
						equal value cats’ food.</p>
					<p>A2: I would like to donate some unnecessary books to
						the organization and buy some cat food if I can afford
						it. Maybe 50$ to 100$.</p>
					<p>A3: I will not donate money, but I can donate cat’s
						food or some goods they need. It will be 300$ equal
						value.</p>
					<p class="kuang-q">Q7 what do you think this website can be improved?</p>
					A1: Too much words in one page, hard to read.</p>
					<p>A2: I hope to see some successful cases of them helping
						stray cats on this website, and to prove that they have
						the ability and conditions to help these cats from being
						hurt</p>
					<p>A3: Maybe this organization can share the monthly
						account book.</p>

					<p>I made one mood board for CCCThis mood board created by Cream yellow，Moeki green, Tang red and Amber
						brown four colors.</p>
					<p>Tang red is a light red with pink tone. It means the warm and sincere love of CCC organization.</p>
					<p>The combine of amber brown and cream yellow is inspired by the interior design area.</p>
					<p>Those two colors can create a warm and harmonious mood, making users feel comfortable during the time they
						watch the website page.</p>
					<p>Moeki green is a Japanese traditional color. That is a strong yellow-green color when the trees sprout in
						spring.</p>

					<p>For the home page, I re optimized the interface layout and deleted some repetitive parts. (e.g. Robbo's

						colour scheme used in mood board is used to make the feeling of the page clearer. Add more photos of
						the cats we've saved and a photo of a person with a cat smiling to give people a basic impression of what
						the organization is doing.</p>

					<p>Compared with the original monotonous pictures, I selected three rescued kittens as examples to tell

						images originally on this page are displayed on the home page.A separate contact us page was canceled.
						Instead, contact us information is placed directly at the bottom of each page. The advantage of this
						design is that after reading the content of the current page, interested users can contact CCC directly
						through the chat window below. At the same time, reduce the number of tags in the title, so that users
						can quickly find the content they are interested in.</p>
